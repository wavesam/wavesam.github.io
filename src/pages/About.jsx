          <p>
            <br />
            At my core, I am a person who believes in the power of growth and
            continuous learning. I have always approached everything in my life,
            including academics, with a growth mindset - being a better person
            than I was yesterday. Even though I will never be perfect, I still
            strive to become the best I ever can be, and this translates deeply
            into my attitude towards learning.
            <br />
            <br />
            Although I have not readily decided on a career as an upcoming
            undergraduate, I aspire to focus on the fields of computer science
            and the internet, and it is highly likely that I will pursue web
            development, a career that depends on one’s capability to learn new
            things in a rapidly evolving landscape where new methods and
            frameworks arise by the year. In my free time, I have dedicated
            myself to building web applications, and my best work can be seen on
            this website: https://sambeige.github.io. <br />
            <br />
            Besides computer science, I also like putting my hands in mechanical
            engineering and introducing it to my undying passion to do better
            for every build I make. A great example of this is when along with
            two other friends, I took a trip to Macau to represent our school in
            a robotics competition
            (https://tis.edu.mo/news/gear-up-for-the-future). We finished as
            finalists largely because our group spent countless hours
            researching how other people built their robots online and applied
            that knowledge to our own robot. Our robot, which started off as one
            which produced average results, became a finalist because of me and
            my friends’ dedication to improving the robot so that it can be the
            best it can be. <br />
            <br />
            Another example of me adopting a growth mindset is in my academics
            in high school. When I was in my freshman year, even though I was a
            passionate learner, I was not getting the grades I desired and I
            believed that I simply was not talented enough. But as I grew older,
            I recognized that all it takes to achieve higher grades is a strong
            dedication to improve, the knowledge of how to study and the
            discipline to stay on task. Hence, my grades went from average to
            above average in my junior year, and I achieved the high honors
            award. I intend to continuously improve my methodology and mindset
            for scoring higher in academics. <br />
            <br />
            Beyond my academic and technical pursuits, I also have a deep-rooted
            passion for learning musical instruments and serving people with it.
            In my free time, along with designing websites, I also play piano
            improvisation and enjoy experimenting with new techniques.
            Additionally, I can proficiently play the violin, the drums, and the
            guitar, and I constantly challenge myself to get better at even more
            instruments. Hence, if there is an opportunity for me to join an
            orchestral club, I would gladly take it as I enjoy performing music
            for an audience and also learning about how orchestras operate. I
            also actively seek opportunities to use my music skills to serve my
            society, with previous examples being joining the worship team and
            the record club (a music concert club) at my high school and playing
            piano for my youth church community once a month. <br />
            <br />
            With an attitude of growth and becoming a better version of myself
            every day, I will apply the same mindset in my studies in
            university. I will strive to score as high as I can academically and
            be as capable as I can be socially, and also encourage my friends to
            approach life with the same mindset.
